        "- **Background**\n",
        "\n",
        "  FraudRisk is a metric that indicates the likelihood of fraudulent activity in a transaction or event. In business, especially in the financial sector like Bank Laks, understanding and predicting this risk is crucial for:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. **Detecting Fraud**: Preventing financial losses that may arise from high-risk transactions, which can directly affect the company's bottom line and damage its reputation with customers and regulators.\n",
        "  2. **Optimizing Business Processes**: By predicting when and where potential fraud risks are high, Bank Laks can prioritize resources and security efforts in more vulnerable areas, improving operational efficiency and reducing associated losses.\n",
        "  3. **Enhancing Customer Trust**: With an effective fraud detection and prevention system in place, customers of Bank Laks will feel safer using the services or products offered, increasing their loyalty and satisfaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Data Context**\n",
        "\n",
        "  The data available for forecasting FraudRisk includes several factors that influence fraudulent activity. The data consists of:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - FraudRisk: The probability of fraud occurring in a given transaction or event.\n",
        "    - CreditDefaultRisk: The risk of credit default, which can increase the likelihood of risky transactions.\n",
        "    - MarketRisk: The risk associated with market volatility, which can affect transaction behavior.\n",
        "    - TransactionVolume: The number of transactions occurring over a specific period.\n",
        "    - AverageBalance: The average account balance over a given period.\n",
        "\n",
        "  This dataset spans one year (2024), making it ideal for time-series analysis to model and predict potential patterns in the future.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Forecasting Objectives**\n",
        "  Forecasting FraudRisk serves several critical purposes in risk management:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Predicting Future Risks: Anticipating the days or periods with high-risk fraud, enabling the company to take proactive measures in advance.\n",
        "  2. Proactive Prevention: Using predictions to implement stronger security measures on days predicted to have a higher likelihood of fraud, reducing the potential for financial loss.\n",
        "  3. Integrated Risk Management: Linking FraudRisk with CreditDefaultRisk and MarketRisk for more strategic business decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Forecasting Approach**\n",
        "  1. Identifying Influential Factors\n",
        "  \n",
        "      Several factors can influence FraudRisk, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Seasonal Trends: Fraud risk may increase during certain periods, such as holidays or during large sales (e.g., end-of-year).\n",
        "    - Transaction Volume: The higher the transaction volume, the greater the potential fraud risk, as more transactions make fraud detection more challenging.\n",
        "    - Correlation with Other Variables: FraudRisk is often correlated with other factors such as CreditDefaultRisk, MarketRisk, or AverageBalance. For example, customers with higher balances or greater credit risk may be more prone to fraud.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Model Selection for Forecasting\n",
        "\n",
        "      Depending on the nature of the data and business objectives, several forecasting models can be considered:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Traditional Statistical Models:\n",
        "\n",
        "      - ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average): Suitable for time-series data with seasonal patterns or long-term trends. However, ARIMA may not handle complex, nonlinear relationships between variables effectively.\n",
        "      - Exponential Smoothing (ETS): Ideal for simple trends and seasonal patterns, but limited in handling interactions between variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Machine Learning Models:\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Random Forest Regressor or Gradient Boosting: Suitable when multiple variables like TransactionVolume and MarketRisk are used as predictors. However, these models require more data exploration to understand relevant variables.\n",
        "      - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A deep learning model for complex time-series data, but it requires larger datasets and longer training times.\n",
        "    - XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting):\n",
        "\n",
        "        XGBoost is selected for its ability to handle data with many features and complex nonlinear relationships. It can manage high-dimensional datasets effectively and is less prone to overfitting. XGBoost is particularly well-suited for data involving TransactionVolume, MarketRisk, and CreditDefaultRisk, and provides fast and accurate predictions with interpretable results.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Business Benefits of Forecasting FraudRisk with XGBoost\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Mitigating Financial Risk: By predicting fraud risks earlier, companies can take preventative actions to avoid significant financial losses.\n",
        "      - Operational Efficiency: By focusing resources on high-risk days or periods, businesses can allocate resources more effectively and prevent fraud.\n",
        "      - Enhanced Customer Satisfaction: Providing better protection against risky activities will make customers feel more secure, increasing their loyalty.\n",
        "      - Improved Strategic Decision-Making: Predictive data can be used to create more proactive policies and optimize fraud detection efforts.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Implementation Stages\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Data Preparation:\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Convert the Date column to a datetime format.\n",
        "      - Check for missing values and outliers to ensure clean, ready-to-use data.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    - Data Exploration:\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Conduct descriptive analysis to understand the data patterns.\n",
        "      - Evaluate the correlation between FraudRisk and other variables and identify any seasonal or trend patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Model Development:\n",
        "\n",
        "      - XGBoost is chosen as the model due to its ability to handle complex relationships in data with multiple variables.\n",
        "      - Train the model using historical data and validate the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Model Evaluation:\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Use metrics such as MAE, MSE, or RMSE to evaluate model performance.\n",
        "      - Conduct backtesting to assess prediction accuracy and ensure the model’s practicality.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Deployment and Monitoring:\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Apply the model to predict future FraudRisk and identify high-risk days.\n",
        "      - Regularly update the model with new data to enhance its accuracy over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "By forecasting FraudRisk, companies can significantly improve their risk management strategies and minimize potential losses due to fraud. The XGBoost model provides advantages in terms of predictive accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability, enabling businesses to optimize resources and design more effective fraud prevention policies."

        "1. Risk Variables (FraudRisk, CreditDefaultRisk, and MarketRisk): The three risk variables have fairly balanced distributions, with means around 0.5, indicating an even mix of low and high-risk data. However, the data does not follow a normal distribution based on the normality test results.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Transaction Volume and Average Balance: These two variables show more significant variation, with a wide range, indicating substantial differences in transaction activity and account balances. The average transaction volume is around 3012, while the average balance is about 558.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Normality Test Results: All variables have a p-value of 0.0000 in the normality tests (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Liliefors, Shapiro-Wilk, and D'Agostino Pearson), meaning the data does not follow a normal distribution. Therefore, statistical techniques or models assuming normality may not be suitable for further analysis. Non-parametric methods or data transformation could be considered if necessary.\n",

        "4. No Missing or Duplicate Data: The provided data contains no missing values or duplicates, allowing for further analysis without additional data handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. No Outliers: There are no outliers in the data for each column, allowing for safer analysis without adjustments for extreme values."

        "Since the data has no missing values, duplicates, or outliers, and all columns are numeric (with the exception of the \"Date\" column), the dataset is already clean and ready for analysis. Given that there is no need for additional cleaning or preprocessing steps, we can proceed directly to forecasting analysis using models like XGBoost.\n",
        "\n",
        "XGBoost is a powerful machine learning algorithm that can handle both regression and classification tasks, making it suitable for forecasting problems where the goal is to predict future values based on historical data. In this case, the dataset contains variables related to risks (FraudRisk, CreditDefaultRisk, MarketRisk), transaction volume, and average balance, all of which can be used as features for the forecasting model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the data does not follow a normal distribution, using XGBoost is a good choice. This model does not rely on assumptions of normality and can handle complex relationships in the data. Additionally, it can efficiently handle various types of variables and scale, making it well-suited for predicting future values such as transaction volume, fraud risk, or credit default risk.\n",

        "Based on the analysis and prediction of fraud risk using the XGBoost model, here are some business recommendations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Implementing Fraud Detection Prediction Model:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Given the accuracy of the model in predicting fraud risk, businesses could consider implementing a real-time fraud risk prediction system. This would help companies detect potential fraud faster, reduce losses, and enhance transaction security.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Optimizing Risk Management:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - By utilizing the model to predict fraud risk, companies can allocate resources more effectively for risk management. For example, focus monitoring or auditing efforts on periods predicted to have higher fraud risks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Developing Proactive Services:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The model can also be used to develop proactive services, such as sending alerts to customers with a high fraud risk, or conducting further verification on suspicious transactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Personalizing Services Based on Risk:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - With the information generated from fraud risk predictions, businesses can personalize services or offers for customers. For example, offering insurance or additional protection for high-risk transactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Optimizing Credit and Transaction Policies:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Fraud and transaction risks can be better predicted using this model. Businesses can set tighter credit policies or offer products with lower risk to customers with a history of high-risk transactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Improving Business Processes with Historical Data:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Using historical data and model predictions, businesses can improve internal processes such as claim processing or customer issue resolution to more effectively handle fraud-related cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, implementing the fraud risk prediction model can provide a competitive advantage in risk management and enhance customer trust by improving transaction security.\n",
